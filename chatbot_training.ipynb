I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__ Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__ Not for me , Dick . __eou__\\n', 'Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? __eou__ Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . __eou__ Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . __eou__\\n', \"Would you mind waiting a while ? __eou__ Well , how long will it be ? __eou__ I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . __eou__ OK . We'll wait . __eou__\\n\", \"Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one . __eou__ Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for . __eou__ The pleasure is mine . __eou__\\n\", 'Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ I am wiped out . Thank you . __eou__ Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Never ! But thank you for inviting me . __eou__ Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . __eou__\\n', \"Can I take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ? __eou__ Well , I want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak . Could she have something else instead ? __eou__ Certainly . How about spaghetti with clams and shrimps . __eou__ Sounds delicious . OK . She'll try that . __eou__\\n\", \"Can you manage chopsticks ? __eou__ Why not ? See . __eou__ Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? __eou__ Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . __eou__ What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . __eou__ According to some studies it may cause cancer . __eou__ Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . __eou__ I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . __eou__ I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . __eou__\\n\", \"I'm exhausted . __eou__ Okay , let's go home . __eou__\\n\", \"Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? __eou__ No , we don't . __eou__ How many of you , please ? __eou__ Six , including two kids . __eou__ I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . __eou__\\n\"]\n"
